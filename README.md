# codejam

This is my playground project for google code jam tasks.
Individual solutions are in respective branches.

Not all solutions do _really_ work - sometimes I give up and move on to other tasks.
I try to avoid cryptic blobs of instructions and crowded one-liners, keeping stuff understandable and sanely named.
Thus, on most occasions code is not that much impressive for well-trained competition coder.
